<h2>Distribution & Logistics</h2>

<p>At first glance, Coyote Business Park’s location in rural Eastern Oregon may appear to be pretty far afield. But take a closer look and you’ll see why companies like Wal-Mart, FedEx, and UPS have set up distribution and logistics facilities in this region. Two major interstate freeways converge here and make same-day, round-trip hauls to each of the Pacific Northwest’s major cities possible. Portland, Seattle, Spokane, and Boise can all be reached in a three- to four-hour drive. A day’s drive can reach Salt Lake City, Northern California, or British Columbia.</p>

<p>Two inland ports on the Columbia River, the Union Pacific Railroad (with special two-day service the east coast via their Railex facility), and Oregon’s largest commercial airport east of Portland help round out the region’s transportation infrastructure.</p>

<p>Although location is likely the top concern for any distribution and logistics project, we know that having a well-trained, reliable workforce is probably a close second. Draw a 25-mile radius around Coyote Business Park and you’ll find a higher concentration of transportation & warehousing workers than anywhere else in the state – more than double that of Oregon, Washington, or Idaho as a whole.</p>

<p>Consider Coyote Business Park for your company’s next logistics project – with easy freeway access, ample workforce, and readily developable land Coyote Business Park is an ideal location for distribution centers, fulfillment centers, trucking hubs, and warehouses.</p>


<h2>Food Processing</h2>
<h3>Oregon Facts & Figures</h3>
<p>Oregon is home to approximately 38,500 farms and ranches. They grow and raise over 250 different crops on 16.3 million acres, fueling a $16.4 billion food manufacturing industry that employs more than 30,000 people statewide.</p>

<p>The five-county region surrounding Coyote Business Park hosts over 5,000 farms that produce over $3 billion in crops and livestock every year. Industry giants such as Conagra and Resers, national favorites like Tillamook Cheese, and all manner of smaller processors are attracted to the region not only for the volume and variety of foods that are grown here, but for the quality workforce they need to support their operations.</p>
