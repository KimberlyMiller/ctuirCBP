<h1>Development Experience</h1>
<p>CTUIR staff have extensive development experience and can assist tenants with every step of the development process, from planning to permitting to construction.  Representative projects include hospitality, retail, health care, government offices, and managed services provider facilities as well as the infrastructure development needed to support those facilities.  Build-to-suit options are available for qualified tenants.  Contact a member of our economic development team today to learn how we can help with your business expansion or relocation!</p>
