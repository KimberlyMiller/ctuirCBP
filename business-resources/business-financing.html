<h1>Business Financing</h1>
<p>Business financing can be one of the most challenging aspects of relocating a business or starting a new one. Fortunately there are a variety of funding sources available to help business owners meet the financial needs of almost any project. </p>

<h2>U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)</h2>
<p>The SBA is a United States government agency that provides support to entrepreneurs and small businesses.  The agency provides access to capital through loans and equity financing and also provides counseling and training for entrepreneurs. SBA small business finance programs include:</p>
</div>

<div class="indented">
<H3>SBA 7(a) Loan Guarantee Program</H3>
<p>This program helps start-up and existing small businesses secure financing when they may not be eligible for business loans through normal lending channels. Loans are funded by banks or other approved lenders, and the SBA guarantee reduces the lender&rsquo;s risk of borrower non-payment. Learn more about the <A href="https://www.sba.gov/partners/lenders/7a-loan-program" target="_blank">SBA  7(a) Loan Guarantee Program</A>.</p>
	
<H3>SBA Certified Development Company 504 Loan Program (SBA 504)</H3>

Eastern Oregon&rsquo;s CDC is the Greater Eastern Oregon Development  Corporation (GEODC), located right here in Pendleton.
