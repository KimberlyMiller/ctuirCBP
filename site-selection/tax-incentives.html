<H3>Indian Employment Tax Credit (IRC Section 45A)</H3>
<p>The Indian employment tax credit provides businesses with an incentive to hire qualified employees who live on or near an Indian reservation. The tax credit is against your federal income tax liability and is 20% of qualified wages and benefits paid to qualified employees.<BR></p>
<p style="padding-bottom:0%">A qualified employee, for any tax period, is any employee who meets all of the following tests:</p>

<UL>
<LI>The employee is an enrolled member of an Indian tribe or the spouse of an enrolled member of an Indian tribe.</LI>
<LI>The employee performs substantially all of his or her services for the employer within an Indian reservation.</LI>
<LI>While performing those services, the employee has his or her main home on or near the reservation.</LI>
</UL>
	
<h3>Opportunity Zone</h3>
<p>The Opportunity Zone applies only to business at Coyote Business Park and not the Wanapa Industrial Site.</p>
<p>The Umatilla Indian Reservation is an IRS-certified Opportunity Zone.  Opportunity Zones are designed to spur economic development by providing tax benefits to investors. First, investors can defer tax on any prior gains until the earlier of the date on which an investment is sold or exchanged, or December 31, 2026, so long as the gain is reinvested in a Qualified Opportunity Fund. Second, if the investor holds the investment in the Opportunity Fund for at least ten years, the investor would be eligible for an increase in basis equal to the fair market value of the investment on the date that the investment is sold or exchanged.</p>
