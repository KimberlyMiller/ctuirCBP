			<h3>Wildhorse Resort Golf Course & Pendleton Country Club</h3>
			<p>Pendleton is fortunate to be home to two terrific golf  courses.  The <a href="http://www.wildhorseresort.com/golf/golf.html" target="_blank">Wildhorse Resort Golf Course</a>, mentioned above, is less than a mile from Coyote Business Park –  close enough to hit the range on your lunch break!  Pendleton Country Club is a member-owned private course just a few miles south of Pendleton.  Both are beautiful, well-groomed courses that provide challenging play for golfers of any skill level.</p>

			<p>Northeast Oregon is a dream for sporting men and women.  The Umatilla River and McKay Reservoir are located right here in Pendleton and together provide fishing opportunities for salmon, steelhead, trout, bass and more. Both are popular destinations for family boating and floating.</p>
			<p>A half hour drive from Pendleton can have you boating and  fishing on the Columbia River, and a drive of just a couple hours can get you  to some of the most storied fishing waters of the Northwest:  Grande Ronde, Deschutes, John Day, Wallowa,  Snake.</p>
			<p>Big game hunting in Northeast Oregon includes elk, deer, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pronghorn antelope, black bear and cougar.  Bird hunters can pursue pheasants, geese, ducks, wild turkey, grouse, quail and more.</p>

  			<p>Like any good city Pendleton has a variety of clean, well-kept municipal parks for family sports and leisure – 21 parks in all. State parks and campgrounds within a half day&rsquo;s drive are too numerous to count.  And for the more adventurous, there are no less than seven federally designated wilderness areas inside a 150 mile radius of Pendleton. </p>

 	<h3></h3>
	<p>Pendleton&rsquo;s proximity to national forest lands – 5.4 million  acres in all between the Umatilla, Malheur, and Wallowa-Whitman National Forests – provides ample opportunities for ATV and snowmobile enthusiasts. Summer or winter, you can spend free time exploring miles upon miles of trails and enjoying the scenic beauty of region.</p>
